================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The method 'sayHello()' returns a constant, making it potentially vulnerable to Infromation Exposure if sensitive data is returned in this manner. Information passed through web requests can be logged in various places, increasing the risk that attackers can discover the sensitive data.
Solution: Never include sensitive data in your URL's query string. Use POST requests and/or encrypt the data when passing sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Active Debug Code
Issue: If the 'sayHello()' function was meant for debugging or testing, it could lead to Information Exposure. Applications often contain hidden debug functionality that is not intended to be used by end users. If an attacker can discover this functionality, they might be able to exploit the intended functionality or to reveal sensitive information.
Solution: Remove any debugging code or make sure it is correctly protected. Ensure that debugging and testing code is not included in released versions of your applications.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Standard Success Scenario

Details:  
  TestName: testSayHelloReturnsCorrectMessage.
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the `sayHello` method returns the correct message "Hello world!". 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup or mocks required.
  Act: Invoke `sayHello` method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string with the expected string "Hello world!".
